# Broadcaster
A mini message broadcaster. It's useful for broadcasting some emergency messages.

This is designed for Windows Operating System. But OSX user can also use it with "poor" user experience.

### Info  
Broadcaster will use the public broker `gyzlab.com:1883`, so if you want to broadcast private messages, please use your own private broker.
